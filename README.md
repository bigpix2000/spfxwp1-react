## rawreact

This is a teaching web part for the SPFX web part in REACT.  It starts out raw and the code here will be a combination of the steps as per the lesson plan.  

Key assumptions to starting at this point is to first get all the prerequisites for creating and working with your own SPFx web part. 

### Building the code

```bash
git clone the repo
